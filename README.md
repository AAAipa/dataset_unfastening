## Dataset Structure

The different datasets contain train and test data. The train and test data is split by lables into loesbar (detachable) and nicht_loesbar (non_detachable). 

### dataset1
Dataset1 contains all available datasets and is split into train/test 80%/20%.

### dataset2
Dataset2 is split into M4/M5 in training and M6/M8 in test.

### dataset3
Dataset3 is split into torx and hexagon socket in train and cross recess and hexagon head in test.

### dataset4
Dataset4 contains all available datasets and is split into train/test 20%/80%.

### dataset5
Dataset5 contains 160 datasets for train and 80 datasets for test.

### dataset6 
Dataset6 contains half of the available data split into train/test 80%/20%.
