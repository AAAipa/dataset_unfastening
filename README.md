## Dataset Structure

The different datasets contain train and test data. The train and test data is split by lables into loesbar (detachable) and nicht_loesbar (non_detachable). 

|Dataset   |Description                 |Trial Number  |Train/Test       |
|:--------:|----------------------------|:------------:|-----------------|
|1         |Benchmark                   |1 & 2         |80%/20%          |
|2         |Screw Size Independency     |3             |80%/20% (M4,M5/M6,M8)|
|3         |Screw Head Independency     |4             |0%/20% (torx, hexagon socket/ cross, hexagon head)|
|4         |Sparse Dataset1             |5             |20%/80%          |
|5         |Sparse Dataset2             |6             |160/80 datasets  |
|6         |Sparse Dataset3/Half Data   |7             |80%/20%          |
